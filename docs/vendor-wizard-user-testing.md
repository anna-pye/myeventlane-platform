# Vendor Wizard User Testing (Event Creation)

This script is for quick, lightweight testing of the Event Wizard with real vendors to validate clarity, confidence, and mobile usability.

## Test setup

- 5–7 vendors (mix: new vendors + experienced vendors)
- Mobile-first testing (primary device is a phone; desktop is secondary)
- Think-aloud protocol: ask participants to narrate what they expect, what they’re looking for, and what they’re unsure about

## Test tasks

1. Create a new event.
2. Complete Steps 1–4.
3. Review and publish.
4. Visit the dashboard.

## Observation checklist (facilitator notes)

- Hesitation: where do they pause, reread, or scroll repeatedly?
- Backtracking: do they go back a step to “fix” something? why?
- Confusion points: labels, instructions, terminology, or missing expectations
- Confidence signals: “this looks right”, “I think I’m done”, willingness to click Publish

## Post-test questions

- Which step felt the easiest, and why?
- Which step felt the hardest, and why?
- Was anything unnecessary or overly detailed?
- How much do you trust the wizard for creating a real event? (1–10) What would make it a 10?
