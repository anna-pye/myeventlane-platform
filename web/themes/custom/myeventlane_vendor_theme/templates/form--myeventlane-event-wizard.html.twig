{#
  EventWizardForm template.
  Renders the wizard structure built by EventWizardForm::buildForm().

  Uses form/event-wizard-form.html.twig to wrap the form with header, body, and
  mobile sticky footer (actions). Drupal's form preprocessing moves form elements
  into the 'children' variable. The wizard structure is included in children.
